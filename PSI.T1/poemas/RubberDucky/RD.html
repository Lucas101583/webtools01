      <p>Rubber ducky in my tub<br>
        help me wash and help me scrub<br>
        all accumulated dirt and grime<br>
        that came from spending too much time<br>
        reading the rag news everyday<br>
        and listening to TV commentaries say<br>
        so many lies and alibis<br>
        for what is happening and all the whys?<br></p><br>

      <p>Rubber ducky floating free,<br>
        that's the way I want to be.<br>
        Stepping out of my tub squeaky clean<br>
        and cleanse my mind from the TV screen.<br>
        For the things I've read that made me mad<br>
        and the things I've seen that made me sad<br>
        should make a whirlpool down my drain<br>
        and never again affect my brain.<br></p><br>
        
      <p>Rubber ducky as yellow as the sun,<br>
        you're the play toy, but I'm the one<br>
        who has to face the world I'm in<br>
        and try my best to discipline<br>
        my reactionary feelings to the grime<br>
        that faces us all in our lifetime.<br>
        So as I clean where you and I meet<br>
        you will be with me and help me defeat falseness.<br></p><br>
