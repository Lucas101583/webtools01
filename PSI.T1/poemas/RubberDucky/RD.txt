Rubber ducky in my tub
help me wash and help me scrub
all accumulated dirt and grime
that came from spending too much time
reading the rag news everyday
and listening to TV commentaries say
so many lies and alibis
for what is happening and all the whys?

Rubber ducky floating free,
that's the way I want to be.
Stepping out of my tub squeaky clean
and cleanse my mind from the TV screen.
For the things I've read that made me mad
and the things I've seen that made me sad
should make a whirlpool down my drain
and never again affect my brain.

Rubber ducky as yellow as the sun,
you're the play toy, but I'm the one
who has to face the world I'm in
and try my best to discipline
my reactionary feelings to the grime
that faces us all in our lifetime.
So as I clean where you and I meet
you will be with me and help me defeat
falseness.
