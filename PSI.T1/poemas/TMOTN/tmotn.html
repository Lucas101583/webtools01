      <p>When demons pick at my troubled mind<br>
        And the passage to sleep becomes harder to find,<br>
        I close my eyes, turn out the light<br>
        And listen to the music of the night.<br></p><br>

      <p>First there's the silence, looming and menacing,<br>
        The audience lies waiting, patiently listening.<br>
        My heart is racing; it's pounding and deafening.<br>
        The taste of tension is sour and sickening.<br></p><br>

        <p>Outside the wind blows a sweet, sad refrain<br>
        That plays on repeat again and again.<br>
        It builds to a crescendo, stormy and wild<br>
        Until it blows over and breathes like a child..<br></p><br>
      
        <p>The rhythm of the night train's clickety-clack,<br>
        'The Moonlight Sonata' for insomniacs.<br>
        It's a song of love and another heart broken<br>
        When so much is said without a single word spoken.<br></p><br>

        <p>A dripping tap becomes a cacophony,<br>
        The percussion in my moonlight symphony.<br>
        Every drip...drip...drop performed in the overture<br>
        Is a well-rehearsed line in my sleepless torture.<br></p><br>

        <p>The hymns of miners lost in the gloom<br>
        Are sang by angels as they circle my room.<br>
        Voices that flicker like light from a flame<br>
        Are swallowed by the coal-black from which they came.<br></p><br>

        <p>Birdsong at dawn, a heavenly choir,<br>
        Brings me to rest and my eyes start to tire.<br>
        While sunlight chases my demons away,<br>
        I fall asleep gently to the sounds of the Day.<br></p><br>
